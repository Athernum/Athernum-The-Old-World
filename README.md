# Athernum : The Old World

In the final days of the Old World, factions rise, alliances crumble, and the power to shape the world's fate lies in the hands of those bold enough to seize it. In this game, you lead powerful characters, claim strategic locations, and shape your own destiny to outwit and overpower your rivals.

Every card you play shapes the battlefield. Every decision brings you closer to victoryâ€”or to becoming just another tale lost in the shadow of the future.

Will you seize your destiny, or be swept away by the tide of war?
