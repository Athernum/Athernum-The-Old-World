# Athernum: The Old World

In the final days of the Old World, factions rise, alliances crumble, and the power to shape the world's fate lies in the hands of those bold enough to seize it. In this game, you lead powerful characters, claim strategic locations, and shape your own destiny to outwit and overpower your rivals.

Every card you play shapes the battlefield. Every decision brings you closer to victory—or to becoming just another tale lost in the shadow of the future.

Will you seize your destiny, or be swept away by the tide of war?

Athernum: The Old World is a tactical collectible card game where you face off against other players with a custom-built deck. You lead a group of characters united by a common goal, with your main character playing a key role in your strategy—though the path to victory is diverse. Unlike many well-known TCGs, combat is not the main focus; instead, success comes from completing objectives, controlling locations, and disabling your opponent’s options. You are not a hero but a strategist shaping the fate of an entire faction—through open confrontation, stealth, or cunning diplomacy.

The world of Athernum stands on the edge of the abyss: old powers have fallen, and new factions battle over the remnants of a broken civilization. Amidst this upheaval, Essence—a scientifically created force—plays a crucial role. It transforms life and the world itself, and only those who master it decide the fate of Athernum

## Unique Card Tokens

The Archen Tactical Card Game System features QR codes printed on their cards. Those codes allow their physical owner to also claim its digital ownership. This can be considered a Non-Fungible Token or NFT. NFTs are a unique digital identifier that are recorded and used to certify ownership of a card. This can also be transferred, allowing cards to be sold and traded not just offline but also online. This makes the Archen Tactical Card Game System a hybrid solution, connecting offline and online activities in a unique way.

The online activities offer not just the ability to build and play decks against NPC players and real life competitors, they also offer different ways to manage a players competitive playing experience. What if a player can register their deck online for a local store tournament or even play sancioned tournaments completely online - gathering real life prices like special full-art prints of their favorite cards. So NFTs allow for small quality of life improvements up to features that entirely rethink the way players collect their cards and interact with the community.

Scanning a claimed card's QR code also allows to access their details like clarifying rules, erata and also their current value in the market
